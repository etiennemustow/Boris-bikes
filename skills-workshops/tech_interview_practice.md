# Tech interview practice

## Learning objectives

By the end of the session you:

- will have experienced, practiced, given & received feedback on tech interviews
- will have access to a long list of tech interview questions

## Practice interviews

Time: 45 mins (15 mins x 3)

### Structure

- Role play: 3 people per group. Each person has a role: EMPLOYER, APPLICANT, OBSERVER.

- EMPLOYER interviews APPLICANT for 10 mins [see here for interview question inspiration](https://github.com/makersacademy/jobhunters/blob/master/interview_questions.md) (look at the "Understanding" section).

- OBSERVER observes interview, time-keeps and runs feedback after interview.

- Switch roles. Repeat until everyone has had a go being OBSERVER, APPLICANT & EMPLOYER

### Feedback

#### Feedback topics

Make sure feedback is as specific as possible.

- WHAT you say.
- HOW you say it
  - Body language
  - Eye contact
  - Tone of voice
  - What you're wearing (research what the the company employees wear)

#### Applicant

At the end of the interview the OBSERVER runs a 5 minute feedback session and

- What do you think you did well? (let applicant reflect and feedback)
- What do you think didn't go so well? (as above)
- What do you want to try next time? (as above)

#### Employer

OBSERVER asks the EMPLOYER for any further feedback points.

#### Observer

OBSERVER adds any further points of their own.

- What are people learning about themselves through this feedback?
- What do people want to work on?

## Retro

At the end, we'll have a retro.
