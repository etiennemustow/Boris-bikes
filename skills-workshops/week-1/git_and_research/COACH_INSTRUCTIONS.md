## Starter (10 minutes)

* Talk about the [goal of the course](README.md#goal-of-the-course).

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

* Talk about how learning is at least 60% of a junior dev's job.

* Remind students they will be pairing and they should work together using the driver/navigator pattern.

* Do a thought shower to gather research techniques from the group.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

## Main (30 minutes)

* Ask the students to collaborate on a Git repo.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* What research techniques did you use?

* What percentage of your time did you spend researching?

* How did it feel to do research in a pair?

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

[No PLENARY.md because there's not really much material besides the questions above.]
