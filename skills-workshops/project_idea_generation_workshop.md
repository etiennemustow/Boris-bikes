# Project idea generation workshop

* People come to the front and pitch an idea in 10 seconds (1 sentence).

* Try to favour "technical" projects that will involve writing some complex logic, rather than "API"ish projects that will be about jamming together a few existing libraries and APIs.

* Your coach will compile all the suggestions in a Google form that you can view.

* In a moment, you'll each choose your top three projects.  But, to reduce the chance of you wasting your choices, the whole group will eliminate unpopular projects.  Your coach will call out each project and you'll raise your hand if you feel you might like to work on it.  Any projects that get less than a 10% vote will be removed.

* Your coach will send out the list of all the projects.  You'll pick your top three.

* Your coach will try to assign you to a team that will work on one of your preferred projects.
